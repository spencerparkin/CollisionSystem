TODO:
====
[ ] Fix moving platform frictionlessness bug.
[ ] Fix jumping bug where sometimes you jump higher than usual.
[ ] Fix falling through platform randomly bug.
[ ] Fix render glitch bugs on character.
[x] Get character animation working (even if it's mediocre like everything else.)
[x] Refactor entire repository into a game engine and game app.  Rename the repo "GameEngine" or something like that.
[ ] Refine the asset tools/pipeline, because it's a bit of a mess.  Can we actually get a rigged/animated character flowing into the engine?  Look at the AssImp library.
[ ] Port engine to DX12.
[ ] Add audio support with direct sound or XAudio2?  Can we do spatial-awareness/3D sounds?
